# StockFellow Affordability Tier System - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

The original StockFellow affordability tier system had several critical issues:

1. **‚ùå Everyone assigned to Tier 1**: Users were incorrectly being assigned to the lowest tier regardless of income
2. **‚ùå No PDF bank statement support**: Users had to manually enter transaction data
3. **‚ùå Limited bank format support**: Only worked with specific JSON transaction formats
4. **‚ùå Poor income detection**: Simple keyword matching missed many income sources
5. **‚ùå No file upload capability**: No way to upload actual bank statements

## Solution Implemented
