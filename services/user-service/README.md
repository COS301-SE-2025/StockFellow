## Affordability Tiers System

The User Service integrates an advanced affordability tier classification system that analyzes users' financial capacity to automatically allocate them into appropriate savings groups.

### Overview

Users are classified into six affordability tiers based on comprehensive bank statement analysis, ensuring they join savings groups that match their financial capacity and reducing default risk.

### Affordability Tiers

| Tier | Profile | Income Range | Contribution Range | Group Size |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | Essential Savers | R2,000 - R8,000 | R50 - R200 | 8-12 members |
| **Tier 2** | Steady Builders | R8,000 - R15,000 | R200 - R500 | 10-15 members |
| **Tier 3** | Balanced Savers | R15,000 - R25,000 | R500 - R1,000 | 12-18 members |
| **Tier 4** | Growth Investors | R25,000 - R50,000 | R1,000 - R2,500 | 15-20 members |
| **Tier 5** | Premium Accumulators | R50,000 - R100,000 | R2,500 - R5,000 | 8-12 members |
| **Tier 6** | Elite Circle | R100,000+ | R5,000+ | 6-10 members |

### Bank Statement Analysis

The system analyzes multiple financial indicators:

#### Core Financial Metrics
1. **Income Stability Score (0-100)**
   - Regular salary deposits
   - Consistent monthly amounts
   - Multiple income sources
   - Growth trends

2. **Expense Management Score (0-100)**
   - Essential vs discretionary spending ratios
   - Debt service ratios
   - Overdraft usage patterns

3. **Savings Behavior Score (0-100)**
   - Regular savings transfers
   - Investment account activity
   - Emergency fund evidence

4. **Financial Stability Score (0-100)**
   - Consistent positive balances
   - Payment history
   - Banking relationship depth

#### Risk Assessment Indicators

**Red Flags (Tier Downgrade Triggers):**
- Frequent overdrafts
- Irregular income patterns
- High debt service ratios (>40% of income)
- Gambling transactions
- Recent account closures

**Green Flags (Tier Upgrade Opportunities):**
- Investment growth patterns
- Consistent income growth
- Disciplined savings behavior
- Multiple banking relationships

### AI Classification Model

The system uses machine learning for accurate tier assignment:

#### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
- **Features:** 50+ engineered features from bank statements
- **Accuracy:** 85-95% tier assignment accuracy
- **Processing:** Real-time inference (<1 second)

#### Feature Engineering
```python
# Key feature categories
- Income stability and growth metrics
- Expense patterns and ratios
- Savings behavior indicators
- Transaction pattern analysis
- Risk and opportunity flags
```

#### Model Deployment
```python
# Real-time tier prediction API
POST /api/users/{userId}/analyze-affordability
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bankStatements": [...],
  "analysisType": "full"
}

# Response
{
  "predictedTier": 3,
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "contributionRange": {
    "min": 500,
    "max": 1000
  },
  "riskFactors": [],
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

### Implementation Features

### Integration with Group Service

The affordability tier system integrates seamlessly with the Group Service for optimal user experience:

1. **Automatic Group Matching:** Users are matched with groups in their tier
2. **Contribution Validation:** Ensures contributions align with tier capacity
3. **Risk Management:** Reduces group default rates through proper matching
4. **Success Optimization:** Maximizes group completion rates

## Authentication

The User Service relies on the API Gateway for authentication and authorization:

### Required Headers
All protected endpoints require these headers from the gateway:
- `X-User-Id`: Authenticated user's unique identifier
- `X-User-Name`: Username from the authentication token
- `X-User-Roles`: User roles (comma-separated for multiple roles)

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends request with Bearer token to API Gateway
2. Gateway validates token with Keycloak
3. Gateway extracts user information and forwards as headers
4. User Service processes request using header information

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- MongoDB 4.4+
- Keycloak server
- API Gateway (configured for header forwarding)

```json
{
  "error": "User not authenticated"
}
```

#### 403 Forbidden
```json
{
  "error": "Access denied"
}
```

#### 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

#### 400 Bad Request
```json

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Validation:** All input is validated before processing
2. **Logging:** Errors are logged with context for debugging
3. **User-Friendly Messages:** Error responses provide clear guidance
4. **Security:** Sensitive information is never exposed in error messages

## Testing

```bash
mvn test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
mvn verify -P integration-tests
```
